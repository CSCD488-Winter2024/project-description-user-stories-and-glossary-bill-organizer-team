# Project Description
Create a website for viewing details on upcoming Washington state legislature actions. The website will fetch data on current bills from relevant websites and display that data in an easy-to-navigate manner. Users will be able to synchronize legislature meeting times to their local calendar, track selected bills, follow various persons to automatically track bills that they have created, and export collected data. Users will be able to search through collected data using various filters. Users will be able to view the history of any bill, including what actions have been taken on the bill, the current status of the bill, and people involved with the bill.

There is a law student here at EWU, who has expressed interest in using this website, and has agreed to help with suggesting on what features are useful and providing feedback as someone who would be a regular user of this site. However, he would not be considered as a sponsor, but definitely can take the role of a client which is very good.
