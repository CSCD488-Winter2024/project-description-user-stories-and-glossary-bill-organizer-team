1. Present the problem statement. For example, an average homeowner designing a new house wants
to play with options for installing solar panels.</br>



2. Explain who the intended user is. It can be you or a fictitious entity you will represent. For example,
the user is a homeowner building a new house.  </br>



3. Describe why the user has this problem. For example, there are decisions to make and many options,
which are difficult to manage for the average user.</br>



4. Describe how a solution would benefit the user. For example, maximizing the solar generation while
minimizing the cost saves the homeowner money. Stay within the scope of the problem; e.g., do not
consider climate change because the connection is too indirect.</br>



5. Describe the general flow for addressing the problem. The existing (or imagined) flow does not have
to involve a computation solution. For example, the user defines the property and house layout and
expected energy needs, then the system proposes solutions that best satisfy the criteria. This used to be
done on paper by expensive expert contractors.</br>



6. What is the general nature of the solution? For example, app, standalone program, website, plug-in.</br>



7. List the general software components you envision playing a role. For example, web server, database,
game engine.</br>



8. List the general hardware components you envision playing a role. For example, drone, VR headset,
tablet. You are responsible for your own hardware, so be reasonable.</br>



9. Describe similar solutions, if any, and justify (or make up a justification) for why they are inadequate.
For example, Project XYZ does something similar, but its cost and complexity are prohibitive. Do not get
detailed with software engineering aspects. Requirements and specifications, for example, come later in
the process, unless they are directly relevant to the proposal and have a justification. For example, an
Android app because you have an Android device and want to become an app developer</br>
